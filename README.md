A website which gets input from the users and fills it in the forms they choose. 
An interactive and beautiful website made of only front-end like HTML, CSS and Javascript which terminates the old method of filling forms with pen physically by filling it virtually. 
Initially we have added first two forms which we use in our college.
The first form is named as MOODLE FA and MOODLE Account Unblock form, which we use to unblock our FA subject and moodle account when we forget to attend the FA or its feedback.
As a update, in the 2nd version we have opened all the other 3 forms - OD (On Duty) Forms for both external events and internships, Attendance unlock form when we forget to affix our attendance biometric in our college.
The basic inputs such as Name, Register number, Email, Mentor name, Mentor Code can typed and Date, Gender, Scholar, Department, Year, Semester can be selected easily.
The input information like event or internship details in OD forms, subject details in MOODLE forms is different for each form.
As V2.2 update, we have launched dropdown using json format in our code for ease selection of subjects in MOODLE forms according to the Department, Year and Semester we choose while filling it and also added number of subjects in it.
Actually the basic working of the code is that we have used a javascript library called jsPDF for mapping the inputs locations in the pdf file attached with this code.
We have made it with basic HTML template and styled it using CSS styles according to our need.
